Exercise 6

This week, we’re going to try to create some reports with Python’s built-in data structures.
For the purposes of this exercise, I’m going to assume that we have a list of dictionaries,
in which each dict represents a person. That dict will then have three key-value pairs:
name
age
hobbies

The final value, “hobbies”, will be a list of strings describing the person’s hobbies.

For example, here is a list of myself and my children:
all_people = [{‘name’:‘Reuven’, ‘age’:50, ‘hobbies’:[‘Python’, ‘cooking’, ‘reading’]},
{‘name’:‘Atara’, ‘age’:20, ‘hobbies’:[‘horses’, ‘cooking’, ‘art’, ‘reading’]},
{‘name’:‘Shikma’, ‘age’:18, ‘hobbies’:[‘Python’, ‘piano’, ‘cooking’, ‘reading’]},
{‘name’:‘Amotz’, ‘age’:15, ‘hobbies’:[‘boxing’, ‘cooking’]}]

You’ll first want to create a list that looks like this.
Note that we have a complex data structure here – a list of dicts,
in which one of the dict’s values is a list.

Given this data (or data like it), I’d like you to produce functions that produce a number of reports:

(1) Return the average age of all people,
 or (optionally) all people under a given age. In other words, you can call:
average_age_under(people)

and find all of the average ages.  or you can call:
average_age_under(people, 20)

and get the average age of those people under 20.

(2) Return a set of the different hobbies enjoyed by people in our database. In other words:
all_hobbies(people)

will return a set of the strings, the hobbies listed for the people.

(3) Return a Counter object indicating how many people have each hobby – that is,
how many people are interested in Python, how many enjoy cooking, and so forth. (I know, in an ideal world, everyone would love Python. But hey, they’re my children, so I’ll forgive them. For now.) This would be the “hobby_counter” function.

(4) Return the n most common hobbies, as a list of strings.
This would be the “n_most_common” function, showing the n most common hobbies in the people. So this:
n_most_common(people, 3)

will return the names of the 3 most popular hobbies among our population.

Hint: Nested list comprehensions and the Counter class will make this much easier!

I’ll be back on Monday with a solution. Meanwhile, discuss it in the forum!
